        Man, it seems like last time I updated this page was years ago! So... what's new? I changed jobs two months ago and I now work for <a href="https://www.accessiway.com/" target="_blank">AccessiWay</a>, a company which tries to help others make their websites, apps and documents more accessible. I love the team and I love the job, so so far so good!<br />On a more "just me" level, another year of singing lessons at the <a href="https://gypsymusical.com/">Gypsy Musical Academy</a> has passed and while making me super stressed it also gave me a lot of joy and self-pride, which doesn't happen often, so cheers to that! I decided to focus on this part of me and that meant spending less time on learning languages, which actually led to not being able to keep up with the workload of the last Swedish course I enrolled in, for the first time in two years and a half. Did that make me think I failed? Yes, at first, but I accomplished other things, and I'm still able to watch Swedish TV series with original subtitles on and understand almost everything, so who cares? Last but not least, I finally decided to give the <a href="/blog" target="_blank">blog</a> another chance. Well, blog... let's say it's a place for all the times I want to jot down something funny or interesting about languages.

        Four months have gone by and it feels like I haven't had the time to do anything, let alone updating this page. So! The website I built for <a href="http://archeplace.org/" target="_blank">Arche Place</a>, an organization that helps victims of domestic violence in the US, went online in November, while the app about seasonal fruits and vegetables I helped developing, after being released on the <a href="https://bit.ly/3MMeH7N" target="_blank">Play Store</a> in September, is now also available on the <a href="https://apple.co/4fLXK9G" target="_blank">App Store</a>!

        Been working at MyEDU for almost 6 months now, got to delve into how
        CKEditor works (jeez) and have a closer look at Next.js. Also been
        working on a <a href="https://bit.ly/3MMeH7N" target="_blank">React Native app</a> about seasonal fruits and vegetables (mostly UI and backend) and a
        nonprofit website for an organization that helps women that are victims
        of domestic violence (not public yet). More on all of that soon!
