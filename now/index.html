        Four months have gone by and it feels like I haven't had the time to do anything, let alone updating this page. So! The website I built for <a href="http://archeplace.org/" target="_blank">Arche Place</a>, an organization that helps victims of domestic violence in the US, went online in November, while the app about seasonal fruits and vegetables I helped developing, after being released on the <a href="https://bit.ly/3MMeH7N" target="_blank">Play Store</a> in September, is now also available on the <a href="https://apple.co/4fLXK9G" target="_blank">App Store</a>!

        Been working at MyEDU for almost 6 months now, got to delve into how
        CKEditor works (jeez) and have a closer look at Next.js. Also been
        working on a
        <a href="https://bit.ly/3MMeH7N" target="_blank">React Native app</a>
        about seasonal fruits and vegetables (mostly UI and backend) and a
        nonprofit website for an organization that helps women that are victims
        of domestic violence (not public yet). More on all of that soon!
